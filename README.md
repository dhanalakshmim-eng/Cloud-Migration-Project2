# Kimai Cloud Migration Project

## 📦 Project Overview

This project focuses on migrating the **Kimai** time-tracking application to a cloud-native architecture using **AWS**, **Terraform**, **Docker**, and **Jenkins**, with a robust CI/CD pipeline, secure access, and full observability.

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

### Textual Architecture Diagram

```
[ User ]
   |
[ Load Balancer (Public) + WAF ]
   |
[ Bastion Host (Public Subnet) ]
   |
[ VPC ]
 ├── EC2 (Kimai + Docker) [Private Subnet]
 └── RDS (MySQL DB)       [Private Subnet]

```



### Security Highlights:

- Bastion host for secure SSH
- IAM with least privilege
- Security Groups with only required ports open
- ALB protected by AWS WAF

## ⚙️ Terraform Setup

- Modular setup for reusability
- Remote state managed in **S3**
- Uses **t3.large** for Kimai EC2 and **t2.micro** for Bastion Host
- Outputs public/private IPs, instance IDs

To deploy:

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve

```

---

## 🐳 Docker Setup

Kimai is containerized with a multi-stage Dockerfile for optimized builds. The container is:

- Non-root
- Has healthcheck
- Ready for production

To build locally:

```bash
docker build -t kimai-app .
docker run -p 80:8001 kimai-app

```

---

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)

Trigger: Push to `main` branch

Stages:

- Checkout
- Build Docker Image
- Run Tests
- Push to DockerHub
- Deploy via SSH to EC2

Pipeline is fully automated using a `Jenkinsfile`.



---

## 🔒 Security

- **WAF** filters traffic on Load Balancer
- **Bastion Host** enables safe key-based access to private instances
- **IAM Role** attached to Kimai EC2 for CloudWatch agent and S3 access

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

- **CloudWatch Agent** installed and configured on EC2
- Monitors:
    - CPU usage
    - Memory and Disk space
    - Application logs
- Alerts configured for:
    - High CPU (> 80%)
    - Health Check failures

### 📈 Grafana Setup

- Grafana installed on EC2
- Connected to CloudWatch via IAM role
- Dashboards created for:
    - CPU Utilization
    - Memory Usage
    - Disk Usage
    - Network Traffic
- Alerts enabled with thresholds

---

## 💵 Cost Estimation (Monthly)

| Resource | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| EC2 (t3.large) | ~$33.28 |
| Bastion Host (t2.micro) | ~$7.62 |
| EBS (28GB total) | ~$2.80 |
| S3 (backups + state) | ~$0.12 |
| CloudWatch | ~$2.00 |
| **Total** | **~$45–48/month** |

---

## 📌 Notes for Teams

- Use Git to always pull latest changes
- All setup scripts are idempotent
- Logs and backups go to AWS
- Easily replicable using Terraform anywhere

---

## 📑 Final Checklist

- ✅ High-Level & Low-Level Design in `/docs`
- ✅ Terraform infra with S3 remote state
- ✅ CI/CD with Jenkins
- ✅ Dockerized Kimai app
- ✅ Secure via Bastion + IAM + WAF
- ✅ Monitoring and alerts with CloudWatch + Grafana
- ✅ Cost Estimate and Final Report generated
